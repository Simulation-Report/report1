CONDITIONS FOR SINGLE CHANNEL QUEUING MODEL
The single channel queuing model can be fitted in situations where the following seven conditions are fulfilled:

The number of arrivals per unit of time is described by poisson distribution. The mean arrival rate is denoted by λ.
The service time has exponential distribution. The average service rate is denoted by μ.
Arrivals are from infinite population.
The queue discipline is FIFO, that is, the customers are served on a first come first serve basis.
There is only a single service station.
The mean arrival rate is less than the mean service rate i.e. λ < μ.
The waiting space available for customers in the queue is infinite.
