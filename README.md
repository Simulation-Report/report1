CONDITIONS FOR SINGLE CHANNEL QUEUING MODEL
The single channel queuing model can be fitted in situations where the following seven conditions are fulfilled:

The number of arrivals per unit of time is described by poisson distribution. The mean arrival rate is denoted by λ.
The service time has exponential distribution. The average service rate is denoted by μ.
Arrivals are from infinite population.
The queue discipline is FIFO, that is, the customers are served on a first come first serve basis.
There is only a single service station.
The mean arrival rate is less than the mean service rate i.e. λ < μ.
The waiting space available for customers in the queue is infinite.


Introduction:
 
To describe queuing problems through mathematical formulation, some assumptions are made by considering arrivals and services as patterned by known function. Equations representing the distribution of the time between arrivals are used with other equations depicting other features such as the distribution of the service time. The relationship existing between these equations is the matter studied in waiting line theory. Arrivals of people or entry requirements (events) are customarily Poisson distributed. The duration of the service provided by people is usually exponentially distributed. For generating interarrival and service times, gamma and Weibull distributions are also utilized depending on the model as the exponential distribution is said to be a special case of both of the gamma and Weibull distributions.
